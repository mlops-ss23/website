# Data Engineering {background-color="#0ca37f"}


*How to collect, process, store, retrieve, and process data*

## Basics of Data Engineering

- Data storage

- Data format

- Data structure

- Data models
  - define how data stored 
  - in a particular data format 
  - is structured

  ## Data Sources


- User input data
  - text, images, videos, uploaded files, etc.

- Internal databases (services and applications)
  - Inventory
  - Customer relationship
  - ... 

- System-generated data
  - Logs (tell you how the system is doing) 
  - System outputs (like model predictions)

- Third-party data

:::{.notes}
- Log everything you can (makes debugging easier)
   - What exactly?
   - How?
   - How long?
   - Privacy regulations?

## Data Sources

- First-party data
  - Data that your company already collects about your users or customers S

- Second-party data 
  - Data collected by another company on their own customers that they make available to you, though you’ll probably have to pay for it
  
- Third-party data
  - Companies collect data on the public who aren’t their direct customers
