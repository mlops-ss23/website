## Business and ML Objectives

- Goal of any project is to increase profits

  - **Directly**: Increasing sales and cutting costs

  - **Indirectly**: e.g., higher customer satisfaction and increasing traffic on a website

- Tie the performance of an ML system to the overall business performance


## E Commerce example

- E commerce site that cares about purchase-through rate

- You want to move your recommender system from batch prediction to online prediction



::: {.notes}
E commerce site that cares about purchase-through rate and you want to move your recommender system from batch prediction to online prediction. You might reason that online prediction will enable recommendations
more relevant to users right now, which can lead to a higher purchase-through rate.
You can even do an experiment to show that online prediction can improve your
recommender system’s predictive accuracy by X% and, historically on your site, each
percent increase in the recommender system’s predictive accuracy led to a certain
increase in purchase-through rate.

## Netflix Recommender example

- Business metric: subscription cancellation rate

- Metric: Total streaming hours

- Netflix measures the performance of their recommender system using take-rate: the number of quality plays divided by the number of recommendations a user sees

- The higher the take-rate, the better the recommender system

- A higher take-rate also results in higher total streaming hours and lower subscription cancellation rates

## A/B Testing  

- Use experiments to learn how ML metrics influence business metrics

- A/B testing to choose the model that leads to better business metrics 

- Regardless of whether this model has better ML metrics.

## ML maturity stage

::: {note}
Returns on investment in ML depend a lot on the maturity stage of adoption. The longer you’ve adopted ML, the more efficient your pipeline will run, the faster your development cycle will be, the less engineering time you’ll need, and the lower your cloud bills will be, which all lead to higher returns. According to a 2020 survey by Algorithmia, among companies that are more sophisticated in their ML adoption
(having had models in production for over five years), almost 75% can deploy a model in under 30 days. Among those just getting started with their ML pipeline, 60% take over 30 days to deploy a model
