# Sampling {background-color="#0ca37f"}

## Nonprobability Sampling 


- Convenience sampling
  - Samples selected based on their availability

- Snowball sampling
  - Future samples are selected based on existing samples

- Judgment sampling
  - Experts decide what samples to include

- Quota sampling
  - Select samples based on quotas for certain slices of data 

## Nonprobability Sampling 

- Sample is not representative for population (selection bias)


## Simple Random Sampling

- All samples in the population have equal probability of being selected

- Easy to implement

- Rare categories of data might not appear in your selection


## Stratified Sampling

1. Divide population into similar groups 
2. Sample from each group separately

- Each group is called a stratum

- Sometimes it's impossible to divide all samples into groups

## Weighted Sampling

- Each sample is given a weight, which determines the probability of it being selected

## Reservoir Sampling

- Useful for streaming data

1. Put the first k elements into the reservoir.
2. For each incoming n*th* element, generate a random number i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
3. If 1 ≤ i ≤ k: replace the i*th* element in the reservoir with the n*th* element. Else, do nothing.

## Importance Sampling

- Sample from a distribution when we only have access to another distribution


# Labeling {background-color="#0ca37f"}

## Hand labels

- Expensive and slow

- Label multiplicity

Annotate all entities they can find:
