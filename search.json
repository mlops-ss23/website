It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or predictors). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‚Äòcriterion variable‚Äô) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.‚Äù\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
